## Getting right to the top - with BYOR approach

### Introduction

LibGDX is a code-centric framework. It's a great strength, and it should be embraced.

Having an editor at heart of the game engine is a common approach. It's a great way to get started, but it can be a limiting factor in the long run. The BYOR (Bring Your Own Renderer) approach is a way to leverage the power of LibGDX while keeping the rendering part of the game engine under your control.

### The BYOR approach

The BYOR approach is about using LibGDX for everything except rendering. It's about using LibGDX for input handling, asset management, physics, and everything else except rendering.
